# MovieRecs

A mood-based movie recommendation web app. You pick how you are feeling, pick a genre, and get a personalised list of 10 movies to watch — no account, no sign-up, no algorithm tracking you.

## What it does

MovieRecs walks you through two choices:

1. **Mood** — how you are feeling right now (Happy, Sad, Excited, Anxious, Romantic, Bored)
2. **Genre** — what kind of film you are in the mood for (Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Animation, Documentary, Crime, Thriller, War)

Once both are selected, the app queries the TMDB movie database using filters tuned to your mood, scores the results using a custom ranking formula, shuffles the top picks so you get something different each time, and displays up to 10 movie cards with poster, title, rating, year, and overview.

## How it works

### Frontend

The frontend is a single HTML page (`frontend/index.html`) with three sections that show and hide one at a time: mood selection, genre selection, and results. There is no framework — just plain HTML, CSS, and two vanilla JavaScript files.

- `frontend/js/api.js` — handles the `POST /recommend` request to the backend and parses the response
- `frontend/js/app.js` — manages all screen transitions, click events, and injects movie cards into the DOM using `createElement`
- `frontend/css/style.css` — layout, buttons, typography, and responsive styles
- `frontend/css/cards.css` — movie card styles

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js and Express server (`backend/server.js`) that also serves the frontend as static files. It exposes one API endpoint:

```
POST /recommend
Content-Type: application/json

{ "mood": "happy", "genreId": 35 }
```

Returns a JSON array of up to 10 movie objects, each with: `id`, `title`, `overview`, `release_date`, `vote_average`, `vote_count`, `poster_path`, `genre_ids`.

#### Recommendation pipeline

**Step 1 — Mood to TMDB filters**

Each mood maps to a hardcoded set of TMDB `/discover/movie` query parameters that control how movies are sorted and what minimum quality thresholds apply:

| Mood | Sort by | Min rating | Min votes | Extra |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Happy | Popularity | 6.5 | 200 | — |
| Sad | Rating | 7.5 | 300 | — |
| Excited | Popularity | 6.0 | 150 | Released in last 4 years only |
| Anxious | Rating | 7.0 | 200 | Runtime 100 min or under |
| Romantic | Rating | 6.5 | 150 | — |
| Bored | Popularity | 6.0 | 500 | — |

**Step 2 — Parallel TMDB fetch**

The genre ID is merged with the mood filters and sent to TMDB. Pages 1 and 2 are fetched at the same time using `Promise.all`, giving a raw pool of up to 40 movies. Any duplicates across the two pages are removed by movie ID.

**Step 3 — Scoring and ranking**

Every movie that has at least 100 votes is scored using:

```
score = (vote_average × 0.7) + (log10(vote_count) × 0.3)
```

The 70/30 split balances critical quality with audience reach. The logarithmic scale on vote count prevents blockbusters with millions of votes from completely dominating critically acclaimed films with smaller audiences.

**Step 4 — Shuffle for variety**

After sorting by score, the top 25 results are taken and shuffled using a Fisher-Yates shuffle. The first 10 from the shuffled pool are returned. This means every request for the same mood and genre combination will return a high-quality but varied set — repeating the same selection will show you different films.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or higher
- A free [TMDB API key](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd movie-app
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory:

```bash
touch backend/.env
```

Add the following, replacing the placeholder with your actual TMDB API key:

```
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

You can get a free API key by creating an account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org) and requesting one under Settings > API.

### 4. Start the server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:3000`. Open that URL in your browser — the frontend is served automatically from the same process.

For development with auto-restart on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Running tests

All tests are inside `backend/__tests__/` and use Jest and Supertest.

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

This runs all three test suites with verbose output:

- `tmdb.test.js` — covers `formatMovie` (field shaping, poster URL construction, null handling) and `discoverMovies` (parallel fetching, page merging, deduplication, error handling)
- `recommend.test.js` — covers `rankAndFilter` (vote count filtering, scoring, top-25 pool selection, Fisher-Yates shuffle, `_score` field removal)
- `server.test.js` — covers the Express app health check, CORS headers, JSON parsing, and 404 handling

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | Yes | Your TMDB v3 API key |
| `PORT` | No | Port the server listens on (default: 3000) |

The `.env` file must be placed inside the `backend/` directory. It is excluded from version control by `.gitignore`.
